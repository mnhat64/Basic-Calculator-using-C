# Basic-Calculator-using-C
Basic Calculator writen in C

This program should let the user choose which operation out of the 4: multiplication, addition, subtraction and division should be done and take is as input 2 numbers.
Again, this is a very basic program using only arithmetical operator in C.

The point of this program is to practice nested loops, and also to let the user choose another operation one after another until he/she chooses to quit the program.
